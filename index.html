          I'm an interdisciplinary researcher trying to bridge the fields of astrophysics and machine learning. 
I work as a Senior Research Associate at the <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu">Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics</a> (New York University) with <a href=https://cosmo.nyu.edu/~mmodjaz/>Maryam Modjaz's group</a>
where I started in 2019.            <br><br><br>
          I started my journey in beautiful Munich in southern Germany and finished my high-school there. 
My first alma-mater is the <a href=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en>Universit√§t Heidelberg</a> where I studied till after 
my Vordiplom in physics. Fate and copious help by one of my first mentors - the late 
<a href=https://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/3612>Rainer Wehrse</a> - brought me 
to Mount Stromlo Observatory working with <a href=https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~brian/>Brian Schmidt</a> as a summer research scholar and later PhD. 
I finished my thesis, titled
<a href=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/10267/2/02Whole_Kerzendrof.pdf>"Type Ia Supernovae: Progenitors and explosions"</a>, in
2011. I then moved to the University of Toronto
with <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~mhvk/">Marten van Kerkwijk</a> as a I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.

From late 2014 to 2018 I was an ESO Fellow at the <a href="http://www.eso.org/">European Southern Observatory</a>. I stayed at NYU (working in <a href=https://cosmo.nyu.edu/~mmodjaz>Maryam Modjaz</a>'s group) and the Flatiron institute until mid-2019.           <br><br>
          <h2> Research overview </h2>
My research interests are astrophysics as well as machine learning. Sometimes these interests overlap - sometimes they don't.

Students (undergraduate/graduate) that are interested in any of these projects please <a href = "mailto: kerzendo@msu.edu">contact me</a>.

<h3> Astrophysics </h3>
A supernova marks the brilliant death throes of a star, during which it outshines its entire galaxy. Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the big bang.

<!-- <strong>Astrophysics:</strong> I focus on stars before, during, and after explosion (exploding stars are also known as supernovae). In my supernova research, I'm particularly intrigued by hydrogen-poor supernovae (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova">Type Ia</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ib_and_Ic_supernovae">Type Ib/c</a>): Why do some explosions in the Universe not show the most abundant element? 
I approach this question from two sides: 1) What was their life like before the explosion? 2) How can we reconstruct the explosion from observations?
For the first topic, I search for former companions that have survived the explosion and can be seen at the site of former explosions (so called supernova remnants ?? insert picture here ??)
I am trying to reconstruct the explosion by using the radiative transfer code <a href="https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/">TARDIS</a> developed by me and my team.

I'm not only interested in explosion. I also am interested in understanding the composition of stars. In particular, I want to understand the unusual elemental abundances in the star cluster around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. <br>

<br><strong>Machine Learning</strong>

Wikipedia writes that "Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data.". I use and research these techniques for various problems. 

Exploring observed spectra of supernovae and stars with sophisticated models is difficult as the parameter space is often large and the models are computationally expensive. I am researching ways to speed up this process by using Emulators. Emulators are machine learning constructs that learn to "emulate" simulations to high accuracy but with computational cost orders of magnitudes less.

Machine Learning has also given us new techniques to analyze and calibrate our data. I started a project while working with the Science Data Group at ESO to think about novell
ways to extract measurements from raw spectral data. In particular, I am developing a
method to use all available information using a statistical framework when extracting
spectra from
<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/xshooter.html">X-Shooter</a> data.
I plan to extend such techniques to other measurements such as photometry and spectroscopy. <br><br>

<strong> Natural Language processing and information science </strong>

Astrophysicists currently publish roughly 15000 papers per year (<a href=https://arxiv.org/help/stats/2018_by_area/index>statistics</a>). This likely means that we are losing track of what we know and what we do not know. I believe that this can be viewed as a big data problem that can rely on the tools and techniquest currently developed. My first project in this direction was a search engine to find similar papers: <a href=http://deepthought.space/deepthought>DeepThought</a>. The second project is to use this techniqe for a smarter more streamlined refereeing process. 
My lofty goal is to make a machine that can answer any astrophysics question from literature also being able to give the answer "We do not know".

<br><strong>Research Philosophy</strong>
My research is tied together with an interest in numerical methods,
novel algorithms and the idea of open software as well as
