    "about_para": "I am an interdisciplinary researcher trying to bridge the fields of astrophysics and machine learning. I work as a Assistant Professor at the Department of Physics & Astronomy and Computational Mathematics, Statistics, & Engineering (Michigan State University) where I started in 2019. My group's website can be found at https://kerzendorf-lab.github.io/. I am the lead-author and PI of the open-source radiative transfer code TARDIS.I started my journey in beautiful Munich in southern Germany and finished my high-school there. My first alma-mater is the Universit√§t Heidelberg where I studied till after my Vordiplom in physics. Fate and copious help by one of my first mentors - the late Rainer Wehrse - brought me to Mount Stromlo Observatory working with Brian Schmidt as a summer research scholar and later PhD. I finished my thesis, titled 'Type Ia Supernovae: Progenitors and explosions', in 2011. I then moved to the University of Toronto with Marten van Kerkwijk as a I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. From late 2014 to 2018 I was an ESO Fellow at the European Southern Observatory. I stayed at NYU (working in Maryam Modjaz's group) and the Flatiron institute until mid-2019."
